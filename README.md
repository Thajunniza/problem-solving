Basic Problem Solvings
# 🧩 Problem Solving with JavaScript

Welcome to the **Problem Solving Hub** —  
a structured collection of coding challenges designed to strengthen your **logic**, **loop control**, and **analytical skills** before diving deep into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

> To master *thinking in code* — breaking problems into steps, recognizing patterns, and building strong logical reasoning.

Pattern printing, recursion, and basic math problems are the **foundation blocks** that make solving complex algorithmic problems intuitive and fast.

## 🧠 Learning Roadmap

| Phase | Focus Area | What You’ll Learn | Example Problems |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| 🟩 **Phase 1: Pattern Problems** | Logic Building & Loops | Nested loops, row–column control, symmetry, spacing | Star Pyramid, Diamond, Number Crown |
| 🟦 **Phase 2: Recursion** | Function Thinking | Base & recursive cases, stack trace, function flow | Factorial, Fibonacci, Sum of Digits |
| 🟧 **Phase 3: Math Logics** | Problem Decomposition | Modular arithmetic, digit logic, conditions | Prime Numbers, Armstrong, Strong Numbers |
| 🟨 **Phase 4: String Problems** | Manipulation & Patterns | Iteration, reversal, conditions | Palindrome, Vowel Count, Character Frequency |
